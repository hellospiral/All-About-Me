      <h1>Introducing Matt Carlson!</h1>

      <p>Hi! I'm Matt, I'm going to tell you a few things about me.</p>
      <p>I am a 32 year old guy from Seattle, WA originally. I have been living in Portland, OR since 2006.</p>
      <p>The main thing I have spent most of my time doing is music. I have released several albums in bands and under my own name, and performed accross North America and in Europe.</p>
      <p>Here is a picture of me perfoming at the LAMPO experimental music series in Chicago:</p>

      <p>Here are <strong>some</strong> of the instruments I play:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Piano</li>
	<li>Synthesizers</li>
	<li>Guitar</li>
	<li>Drums</li>
	<li>Bass Guitar</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Here are my 3 websites where you can find out more about and listen to some of my music:</h3>

      <p> <a href="http://bucketfactory.com">BucketFactory.com</a> is a site I made to sell my LPs.</p>
      <p> <a href="http://soundcloud.com/matt-carlson">My Soundcloud</a> site has more of my own stuff.</p>
      <h3>Background</h3>
      <p>I studied Music Composition at Cornish College of the Arts in Seattle, after which I moved to Portland and began integrating myself into the music and art community. I spent a few years doing an art collective called <a href="http://oregonpaintingsociety.org">Oregon Painting Society</a>, which performed at the Tate Modern in London!</p>
      <p>Here is a picture of us taken in London for Italian Vogue:</p>

      <p>I have been supporting myself by working for a company scoring essays for the ACT, and teaching some music lessons. But my employer is cutting my pay by over <em>50%</em> so I need a new career path. This is why I'm learning coding! I used to make websites a lot when I was much younger and think I have an aptitude for understanding programming.</p>
      <p>Here are three reasons I think I can be good at coding:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>I am very fast at working with text; both typing and comprehending.</li>
	<li>I enjoy working with abstract formal systems.</li>
	<li>I am very self-motivated and enjoy figuring out how to solve problems.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Okay I think that's all for now! Thanks for reading about me.</p>
